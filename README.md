# Akira
An advanced but not so advanced discord bot

## Getting Started
Modify the [slappey.example.json](https://github.com/japandotorg/Akira/blob/main/slappey.example.json) with your credentials and rename the file to **slappey.json**
```json
{
  "name": "YOUR-BOT-NAME", 
  "language": "javascript",
  "manager": "npm",
  "token": "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN",
  "prefix": "YOUR-PREFIX"
}
```
Open [install.bat](https://github.com/japandotorg/Akira/blob/main/install.bat) or run `npm install` in your terminal to install all the dependencies <br>
Open [start.bat](https://github.com/japandotorg/Akira/blob/main/start.bat) or [devstart.bat](https://github.com/japandotorg/Akira/blob/main/devstart.bat) to start the bot <br>
Or you can start the bot manually in your cmd/editor terminal using `npm start` or `npm run dev`

## Note
The bot is still under development so there are still alot of things to go, and also I'll make a better readme after i'm completely done building the bot <br>
If you need any help you can dm me @inthedark.org#0666
